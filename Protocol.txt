The PyChat protocol is the unified way for clients to communicate with PyChat servers.

Commands:

BYE - Disconnects a client from the server.

NICK <nickname> - Changes the client's nickname. This command must be issued when a clienct connects. This and BYE are the only two commands available before authentication.

JOIN <room> - Adds the client to the named room.

PART / EXIT <room> - Removes the client from the specified room.

MSG <room> <message> - Sends <message> to everyone in <room>.
